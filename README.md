## Project Overview:
We propose to develop a machine learning model that predicts credit card approval decisions based on applicant information. This project aims to automate and enhance the credit card approval process, improving efficiency, accuracy, and customer experience.

**Objectives:**
 To Build a predictive model that evaluates applicant data to determine the likelihood of credit card approval.

## Methodology:
1. **Data Collection:** Gather historical credit card application data, including applicant attributes such as income, credit score, employment status, and existing debts.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Cleanse and preprocess the data by handling missing values, standardizing formats, and encoding categorical variables.
3. **Feature Selection:** Identify relevant features that contribute significantly to the prediction task, ensuring the model's efficiency and accuracy.
4. **Model Selection:** Experiment with various machine learning algorithms, such as logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests, to determine the most suitable model for credit card approval prediction.
5. **Model Training:** Split the dataset into training and validation sets to train and fine-tune the selected model's parameters.
6. **Model Evaluation:** Assess the model's performance using appropriate evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
